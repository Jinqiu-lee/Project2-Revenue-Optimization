# Holiday Uplift and Revenue Optimization (Walmart Sales)

This project analyzes Walmart weekly sales data to understand how different holiday periods affect revenue.
The goal is to help retail teams forecast demand, optimize inventory, and maximize holiday revenue.

Instead of treating all holidays the same, I grouped them into three business-driven holiday types and analyzed how each impacts sales.


### 1. Business Problem:
1. Poor and good holiday sales forecasting.
2. Which holidays truly drive revenue
3. How should businesses prepare for each type?

    
### 2. The Solution:
  1. I used time series to forecast the sales, and compare with the macro economic index and other retails to determin the real problem.
  2. Analyzing the data by seasonality, holiday or non-holiday, location etc. to find out what is the biggest factor for sales performance
  3. Instead of using a single “Holiday” label, I created three holiday categories, and store segmentation. 
  4. For different holidays and top 30 stores which has the big impact from holiday, businesses can :
     - Plan inventory differently
     - Adjust promotions by holiday type
     - Improve forecasting accuracy


### 4. Key Insights:
This project shows:
  - Major holidays create the largest and most predictable revenue spikes(Black Friday + Thanksgiving)
  - Medium holidays still matter but need lighter inventory planning (Superbowl)
  - Minor holidays often do not justify aggressive promotions, or avoid promos(Christmas + New year)

These insights help retailers increase profit while reducing risk and cost.


### 5. Business value:
With this system, a retail company can:
  1. Forecast holiday sales more accurately
  2. Avoid over-stocking and allocate right products based on store segmentations in different holidays
  3. Improve promotion planning and maximize revenue during peak weeks
