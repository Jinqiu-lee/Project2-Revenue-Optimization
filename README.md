# Holiday Uplift and Revenue Optimization (Walmart Sales)

This project analyzes Walmart weekly sales data to understand how different holiday periods affect revenue, what is the main driver affect sales performance.

The goal is to help retail teams forecast demand, optimize inventory, and maximize holiday revenue.


### 1️⃣. Business Problem:
1. Poor and good holiday sales forecasting.
2. Which holidays and factors truly drive revenue?
3. How should businesses prepare for each type?

    
### 2️⃣. The Solution:
  1. I used time series to forecast sales, and compare with the macro economic index and other retails to determin the real problem.
  2. Analyzing the data by seasonality, holiday or non-holiday, stores etc. to find out what is the sales driver
  3. Instead of treating all holidays the same, I grouped them into three business-driven holiday types,and based on the sales driver analysis, I segmented store into four clusters, and analyzed how each holiday impact sales per cluster.
  4. For different holidays and top 30 stores which has the big impact from holiday, businesses can :
     - Plan inventory differently
     - Adjust promotions by holiday and store type 
     - Improve forecasting accuracy


### 4️⃣. Key Insights

This project shows:
  - Different stores performances vary greatly during holiday periods, which has a significant impact on inventory reallocation and marketing strategies. 
  - Major holidays create the largest and most predictable revenue spikes(Black Friday + Thanksgiving)
  - Medium holidays still matter but need lighter inventory planning (Superbowl)
  - Minor holidays often do not justify aggressive promotions, or avoid promos(Christmas + New year)

These insights help retailers increase profit while reducing risk and cost.


### 5️⃣. Business value:
With this system, a retail company can:
  1. Forecast and optimize holiday sales more accurately.
  2. Avoid over-stocking and allocate right products based on stores in different holiday periods.
  3. Improve promotion planning and maximize revenue during peak weeks.
